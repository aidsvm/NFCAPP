# Android-based NFC Data Retrieval Mobile Application

## Description
The goal of this project is to design and develop software that retrieves information
about objects based on scanning the NFC tags attached to the object, for example, room, book, etc.
Information about the specific object should be retrieved from the relational database and
displayed on a mobile phone's screen. Back-end containerization using Docker containers must be
used. Access control policies should support two roles: administrator, user. Administrators shall
be able to add new objects to the database and map/connect them to NFC tags, correspondingly.
Users and administrators shall be able to scan the NFC tags and view the relevant database record
about one single object that corresponds to the NFC tag. The software is expected to work on
mobile devices that have NFC support (for example, the new models of Android smart phones or
iPhones).
